            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Edwin Hadass. I am a student at the University of Warwick, currently studying 
                Computer Science. This website is a place where you can find descriptions of and reflections on
                some of the programming projects and ideas that I have worked on in my spare time.

            <p>
                I have a lot of expereince in object-oriented-programming, especially with the C-family of languages, 
                alongside Java, Haskell, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked with a lot of game-development 
                and graphical programming tools including but not limited to: Unity, Godot, Monogame, SDL, OpenGL, as well
                as web frameworks such as Flask.
